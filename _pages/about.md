# Welcome to Puyang's Digital Den! 🚀

## 👋 Hello, I'm Puyang!

🎓 I'm currently a Ph.D. student in Biostatistics and Data Science at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. My research is like being a data detective, focused on cracking the secrets of nicotine and tobacco, especially e-cigarette use behaviors and their health impacts. 📊

🌏 Before coming to Texas, I delved deep into Mathematics and Statistics at The University of Melbourne, earning my master's degree. There, I mastered the "spells" of statistics and stochastic processes, laying a solid foundation for my current research. 📈

## 🔬 My Research Interests:

- Data Mining: Like an archaeologist, unearthing precious information treasures from vast amounts of data 💎
- Applications of Machine Learning in Health and Behavioral Sciences: Using the power of AI to decipher the puzzles of human behavior 🧠
- And more to explore! I'm always curious and open to new research areas 🚀

Join me on this data adventure! Let's explore the magic of statistics and uncover the mysteries of health together! 🚀✨
